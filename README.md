### 🐸 Hey 🐸 | My name's K.O🐸 and i ***LOVE FROGS!***
> I made soem personal projects (in python).</br>
> Love what i do btw.

# Things i like to do:
- **Visual projects:** For example, the *particle simulator*
- **Malware:** In the past, i made some malware (I've lost them, but one day i'll remake them):
  - **MasterSword:** A simple terminal based ransomware.
  - **MasterKey:** A *PowerShell* script, made for bruteforce *adm* passwords to access a *exisisting admin account* (i tested it in my school, it was cool :O).
  - **KOmOr:** KOmor (Keyo, the moron) is a *trojan*, it makes itself to open every time when the pc boots.
